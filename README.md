# Neighborhood-Map-FEND

This project is a requirement of Udacity front end nanodegree. It is a "neighborhood map", a single page app utilizing various APIs and frameworks. I chose Bellingham, WA because I like that area but I do not currently live there. :)

### APIs, Libraries, and Frameworks:
1. [Google Maps Api](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
1. [Flickr Api](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) (ajax request)
1. [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
1. [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/)
1. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)


### How to Use the App:
##### Easy way (but not as good):
1. Download (or clone) this repo to your computer
1. Unzip the file and navigate to the unzipped folder
1. Locate the file titled index.html
1. Open this index.html file in your web browser
1. All should be working :)

##### Better way:
1. Follow steps 1 and 2 above
1. Open Terminal and cd into the folder containing the index.html file
1. Be sure you have python installed (type: ```python --version```)
1. If you do not have python then follow the easy way above ;)
1. Type the following command: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```
1. Open your web browser and enter ```0.0.0.0:8000``` as the url.
1. Voila! You can use this simple app.

##### Notes:
Refactoring is almost certainly necessary. Since this is not for production then workflows such as grunt or gulp were not utilized. Code was sent through various validators.
